How to use data class
first you have to import it in your class :
import geni.data.*;
then you can access data in two ways.
First :
pokedex.name.fuction
Second :
pokedex.values()[index].function

index will go from 0 to 150 so if you want Mew you need to use PokedexRealID which in our
case is 151 and subtract 1.

available functions : 

getBattleData() : returns a integer array of base stats of the pokemon in the following order

index - Data
--------------------
0     - Total Stats
1     - HP
2     - Attack
3     - Defense
4     - Sp. Attack
5     - Sp. Defense
6     - Speed

getType1() : returns an enum value of first battle type of the selected pokemon

getType2() : returns an enum value of the second battle type of the selected pokemon

Look at the enum section to see how you can extract data from these types of variables

Class enum type :
To use this you have to import the following :
import geni.data.*;

How this can be used? Well, this class lists all the available pokemon types and the effectiveness of specific types of moves on the types of pokemon.

Two ways to access :

First :

type.nameOfType.function

Second :

type.values()[index].function

index can have values between 0 and 14 

Index  -  Name of Type
----------------------
0      -  Normal
1      -  Fire
2      -  Water
3      -  Electric
4      -  Grass
5      -  Ice
6      -  Fighting
7      -  Poison
8      -  Ground
9      -  Flying
10     -  Psychic
11     -  Bug
12     -  Rock
13     -  Ghost
14     -  Dragon


Available functions :

getBattleCoefficients();

This returns an array of doubles. Each index shows how the current selected type fairs
against the other 14 types. i.e.

type.Fire.getBattleCoefficients()[i] if the specific index i is equal to 4
then the value that would return is 2.0 which means that the damage incurred from
a fire attack on a grass pokemon is 2 times effective.

i takes values between 0 and 14 and correcspond to the following

Index  -  Name of Type for which the coefficient of battle is given against
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0      -  Normal
1      -  Fire
2      -  Water
3      -  Electric
